# Youtube-player

SPA for putting all of the skills I leanred at NSS together to create a youtube player that allows users to filter on video type, create entries, and delete entries.

Sample site: https://drt-youtube-player.netlify.app/#

Concepts and skills I used to build this app:
- Data as Entities
- HTML representation of data
- Iteration (loops)
- Reading data on the DOM
- Creating data
- Functions
- Events

My Steps:
1. Create the structure of HTML
1. Create renderToDom utility function
1. Start building the HTML components and render on DOM
1. Add event listeners
1. Get button filters working
1. Get watch buttons working
1. Get delete buttons working
1. Add form to CREATE new items
